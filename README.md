# MultivariateHawkes
Code and Simulation study for "Estimating Product Cannibalisation in Wholesale using Multivariate Hawkes Processes with Inhibition"


## 01_libraries
contains all libraries needed for the analysis
in addition, settings for Stan are chosen

## 02_functions
all functions for the generation of data and additional analysis

## 03_stan
functions for model fitting making use of Stan

## 04_stynthetic_data
two examples on synthetic data, where data is generated and the model is fitted
please load files 01, 02, and 03 first

## 08_intergral approximation_study
from paper appendix to demonstrate the goodness of our approximation of Lambda, including visualisation
please load functions beforehand

## Simulations 
contains data for the simulation study, which is generated by 04
